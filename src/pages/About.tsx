                Hi! I’m <span className="text-primary font-bold">Aria</span>, a
                digital dream-weaver and illustrator based in sunny Orange
                County, CA. I graduated from California State University,
                Fullerton, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Illustration, and
                I’ve spent the past 8+ years turning pixels and pen strokes into
                playful adventures. My art spans mobile games and the bookish
                world, from Young Adult to Contemporary Romance, bringing
                vibrant characters, magical landscapes, and quirky details to
                life!
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8 text-[#322528]">
                When I’m not conjuring whimsical worlds on screen, you can
                usually find me hiking new trails with my dog, Hojo, getting
                lost in a book, or leveling up in a video game. I love
                collecting inspiration from everyday sparks of life and turning
                them into illustrations that make hearts smile. Currently, I
                freelance but am open to full-time in-house opportunities, and
                I’d love to hear about your project.{" "}
